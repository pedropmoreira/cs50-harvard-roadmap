# 📚 CS50: Journey

Hey my name is Pedro Paulo i'm from Brasil and welcome to my CS50 repository! 🚀 Here you will find my notes, and basic room examples developed throughout the **CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science** course at Harvard.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository was created to document my progress and learning throughout the course, as well as to serve as a future reference for myself and anyone who wants to learn along. **No code here contains solutions to the problem sets (due to the course's academic honesty rules).**

## 📁 Contents
- 🔹 **Notes**: Summaries of important concepts learned in each module.
- 🔹 **Experiments**: Extra codes I developed to explore the course concepts.
- 🔹 **Basic room examples**: Basic room examples given in class.

## ⚠️ Academic Honesty
According to CS50's guidelines:
- **Allowed**: Sharing explanations, discussing concepts, publishing your own projects, and improvements.
- **Not allowed**: Sharing direct solutions to problem sets, copying code from other students without permission, or using AI to solve course problems.

>"This repository does not contain official CS50 solutions."
## 🎯 Goal
Finish CS50 and consolidate my knowledge to pursue a career in **Data Engineering, Data Analysis, or Full Stack Development**. 🚀
